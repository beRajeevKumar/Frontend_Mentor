- Learn new frameworks and technologies to stay up-to-date and increase my versatility. This includes exploring JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to build interactive and dynamic web applications.

- Focus on backend development by learning technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This will enable me to build fully-functional, full-stack applications.

- Prioritize responsive design, accessibility, and SEO best practices to ensure the websites I build are high-quality, user-friendly, and optimized for search engines.

- Continually challenge myself to expand my knowledge and skills, pushing the boundaries of what I'm capable of as a developer. This commitment to lifelong learning will be a driving force in my professional growth.
